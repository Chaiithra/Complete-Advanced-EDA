## 📦 Project Overview

This project involves cleaning and analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and insights, and to prepare the data for future machine learning applications.

**Objectives:**
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Perform structured EDA (univariate, bivariate, multivariate)
- Derive insights useful for prediction
- Prepare data for ML model building

---

## 🧰 Key Features

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Renamed columns with regex for clarity
- Engineered new features like `family_size`
- Dropped high-null or irrelevant features (e.g., `Cabin`)
- Handled missing values using domain-informed imputation
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding
- Treated outliers using IQR capping

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate:** Distribution plots (histograms, KDE, boxplots)
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:**
  - Correlation matrix for numerical relationships
  - Category-wise survival analysis using bar charts and group stats
  - Multivariate visualizations using heatmaps and pair plots

## 🎯 Key Insights

- Most passengers were in the 20–30 age group.
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- Females had significantly higher survival rates than males.
- Smaller families had better survival outcomes compared to larger ones.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Train baseline ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
- Apply feature selection & hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate model metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC)
